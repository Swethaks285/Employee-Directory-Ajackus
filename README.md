🔧 Challenges Faced

-Faced difficulty using Freemarker templates for mock data, which led to switching entirely to plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💡 What I'd Improve If I Had More Time
Add localStorage support to persist employee data across refreshes.
Enhance UI with better styling, animations, and loading indicators.
Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels.
