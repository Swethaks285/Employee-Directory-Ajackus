## ✨ Reflections

### 🔧 Challenges Faced

- Faced difficulty using Freemarker templates for mock data, which led to switching entirely to plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 💡 What I'd Improve If I Had More Time

- Add **localStorage** support to persist employee data across refreshes.
- Enhance UI with better styling, animations, and loading indicators.
- Add **pagination** or infinite scroll for large datasets.
- Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels.
